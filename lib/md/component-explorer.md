# Use a component explorer

Component explorer is a UI visualization and sandboxing tool.

There are great tools for showcasing your React, Vue or Angular UI components and sharing them with Project Managers, stakeholders, designers, other developers, etc.

They enable you to create a single point of truth for UI components, demo how they look and behave. You can summarize all the possible building blocks available in a component library or web application.

Component explorer is also a great place to develop new components in, isolating them from the rest of the system and enabling a self-contained and fast sandbox for development.
